# real-time-bus-tracker

This project accesses the bus routes between the MIT campus and Harvard's campus. The marker moves between the different stops. It uses mapbox's API and has added to it a line to highlight the route of the bus and allows the user to view the content in satellite terrain. This project allowed me to use my skills in CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. 

To run the is project. Open the HTML file in your local browser. A map should appear with a highlighed route. Click the button in the upper left hand corner of the screen. The marker will then follow the route and pause at the defined bus stops betweent the two campuses.

Future imporvements can include: allowing the line to follow as the marker progresses throught the stops, change the view to non-satellite, and even adding extra layers to the map to get exact locations of the stops.
